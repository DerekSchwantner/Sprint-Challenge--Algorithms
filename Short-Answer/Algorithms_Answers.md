#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n). Linear Time


b)nested loops, greater inputs do not increase performance linearly. O(n^2)


c)O(n). Linear Time. 

## Exercise II
assume floors = sorted ascending list of floors

#start halfway up the floors list to drop first egg

def find_f()
middle_floor_index = floors[len(floors // 2)]

search for f by using a binary search algorithm
if egg_breaks() == True
    return find_f(floors[:mid])

if egg_breaks() == False
    return find_f(floors[mid:len(floors)])
    
complexity is O(log n) for binary search
